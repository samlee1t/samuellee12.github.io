title: Summer 2015 Project
---

This past summer, I prototyped a quadcopter as part of the Bridge-MINDER NSF project at Rutgers University. This involved the assembly of the frame itself along with designing sensor placement. 

Throughout the summer, we calibrated the ESCs and motors and used a Vicon Motion Capturing system to verify the onboard gyroscope and accelerometer data. 
Much of my job consisted of learning the software involved with this (RobotOS) as well as designing and fabricating custom mounts for sensors, the camera gimbal, and battery. Parts included: X580 frame, carbon fiber props, ESC32, Pixhawk flight controller, and ODROID onboard computer.

We also created an indoor testing environment (for testing during bad days) in a cage that included IR cameras for motion capturing as well as nets for safety. Much of our calibration was done in this environment.
