title: Ship Boundary Layer
---

I recently started work on a PhD at the University of Maryland, College Park in the Hydrodynamics Lab where I will be focusing on experimental investigation of strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions. I started working with a Ship Boundary Layer device that emulates ship hulls. It consists of a 7.5 m continuous stainless steel belt that is driven by two vertically-oriented rollers. These rollers are powered by a hydraulic power unit that operates at 200 bar (~3000 psi) and are capable of driving the belt with accelerations up to 3 G and velocities up to 10 m/s. The measurement area consists of an area where the water-air-structure interface exsists. When viewing a measurement area from a static position, the distance traveled by the belt is analogous to the length along a ship and thus the boundary layer that develops in time is analogous to the boundary layer that develops along the length of a ship hull.

I am currently using the shadowgraph method to measure the size, number, position, and velocity of bubbles that are present within the boundary layer. We are accomplishing this by using two 1000 W white lights to illuminate the measurement area and a Phantom Veo 640 camera to capture the high speed movies. Below is an image of the setup and a sample movie.
