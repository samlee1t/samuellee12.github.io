title: High Speed Slamming of Flexible Plates on Water
---

I started working on a second project - high speed oblique impacts of flexible plates on quiescent water surfaces driven by a two-axis carriage system. This system uses the same hydraulic power unit as the Ship Boundary Layer device to drive the horizontal motion at accelerations of up to 3 G to speeds up to 10 m/s. The vertical motion is driven by an electric servo motor contained inside the carriage. Instrumentation for measuring force, moment, pressure, and strain experienced by the plate are currently in place. The force and moment are measured using four load cells mounted on a dynamometer frame while the pressure and strain are measured by fiber optical sensors. The spray generated by the impact can also be measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or qualitatively captured using white light movies.

The current experiment I am working on is the investigation of the effect of different pitch angles on the fluid-structure interaction. We are performing this by keeping the normal impact velocity the same across all pitch angles while varying other variables such as the ratio of horizontal to vertical speed and the submergence time of the plate (beginning when the trailing edge of the plate impacts the water and ending when the leading edge of the plate reaches the still water level).
