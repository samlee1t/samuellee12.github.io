title: Kossel Calibration
---

Due to school, I haven't had much time to play around with my Kossel, however I did get a chance a couple weeks ago to calibrate it to a printable level. 

The process went something like this: 
1) Ensure bed levelness by adjusting the endstops and the screw on the carriages.
2) Flatten effector travel by adjusting DELTA_RADIUS in Marlin.
3) Correct XY plane print size by adjusting DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD.
4) Correct Z print size by adjusting Steps per MM.

Here is a picture of a couple (9 of them, I believe) calibration pieces that I printed while adjusting the print size:
