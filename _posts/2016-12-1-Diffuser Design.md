title: Diffuser Design for Fluid Mechanics
---

One of our recent assignments was to design a lifting diffuser designed to lift business cards using fluid mechanics concepts. The input to the diffuser is a positive pressure at about 20cm H2O, which results in a positive velocity into the diffuser. The diffuser works by redirecting the air from vertical velocity to horizontal velocity across the bottom surface of the diffuser. This horizontal high velocity region then results in a low pressure region which has a pressure lower than that of atmospheric, which then has a lifting force.

Additionally, there is another concept called entrainment going on here. This is when the horizontal velocity creates a vortex of some sorts that circles around and actually creates a suction towards the diffuser. 

This project was printed on my Kossel Mini. Many of the imperfections, especially on the bottom surface are due to a lack of infill and solid layers. This was done because of a time constraint when I was printing the part. It was printed in two parts, the main connector and the diverter. The diverter was superglued onto the connector. I could have iterated on the prototype more to maximize the horizontal velocity by decreasing the height of the channel where the air flows out, but time was not available. This design ended up lifting 10 business cards with the 20cm H2O pressure.
